# Terminal-Based World Simulation

This is a terminal-based world simulation game that is inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and RimWorld. The game is written in Python and is designed to be highly moddable and extensible.

## Features

* **Object-oriented design:** The game is written in an object-oriented style, which makes it easy to add new features and content.
* **Blueprint system:** The game uses a blueprint system that is based on XML files. This allows you to easily create new life forms, items, and other objects without having to write any code.
* **Step-based simulation:** The game is a step-based simulation, which means that the world is updated in discrete time steps. This allows for a high degree of control over the simulation and makes it possible to create complex and emergent behavior.
* **Balanced ecosystem:** The game features a balanced ecosystem in which the populations of the different life forms are kept in check by a variety of factors, such as predation, disease, and starvation.
* **Evolution:** Life forms in the game can evolve over time, which can lead to the emergence of new species and the extinction of old ones.

## Installation

To install the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed. You can then install the game by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the game, you can use the following command:

```
python src/main.py
```

## Modding

The game is designed to be highly moddable. You can create new life forms, items, and other objects by creating new XML files in the `blueprints` directory. You can also modify the game's code to add new features and functionality.
